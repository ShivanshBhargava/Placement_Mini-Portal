## 🧭 1. Project Overview  
**Placement_Mini_Portal** is a web-based platform designed to simplify and digitalize the campus placement process. It allows students to register, build their profiles, browse company listings, and apply for job postings.  
At the same time, companies can post job openings, track applications, and review applicants efficiently.  

The system aims to bridge the communication gap between students and recruiters, making the placement process more transparent and organized.

## ❗ 2. Problem Statement  
The current placement process in many colleges involves scattered spreadsheets, manual form submissions, and repeated communication between students, placement cells, and recruiters.  
This results in:  
- Inefficient tracking of applications  
- Missing information or duplicate data  
- Delayed updates on selection status  
- Difficulty in matching students to suitable openings

## 💡 3. Proposed Solution  
A **centralized mini-portal** that automates registration, job postings, and application tracking for students and recruiters.  

The platform will:  
- Allow students to register and maintain an updatable profile.  
- Display all available job opportunities in one place.  
- Enable students to apply directly to jobs and track their application progress.  
- Let placement admins or companies manage listings and view applicant statistics.
